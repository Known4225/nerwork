# nerwork
The nerwork is a neural network visualisation tool, but really it's my implementation of a neural network for the MNIST dataset.

It's "general" and "versatile" but like not really.

I've included the MNIST csv file, which is the only one it can read probably.

To run: python3 nerwork.py -f mnist_test.csv

This will run the program with the specified file.
At the bottom of the python code you can get it to train, or draw your own numbers and run the network on them (very slow, i will optimise eventually)

This is still a work in progress
